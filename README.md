# Business Analytics Report

### Running an analysis on Tableau Superstore Dataset to find key insights to make better business decision for managers 

## Summary 
We will be looking at the overall data, before deep diving into the components which have interesting trends to help us understand what we can improve on to increase profits.
Looking at the overall profits and sales by clustering the countries into 3 clusters: high, medium, low allow us to better understand which region is doing well. It will also help us better look at which country is driving the most profits and apply their best practices to the other clusters.
With our best performing and worst performing country, we will investigate them to see the most profitable category. This allows us to study the trends that States of the countries are making. From there, we can make decisions if certain areas are worth investing on.
Understanding that the Furniture Category is not doing so well based on data shown in States of countries, we further investigate on it. Looking at the trend of category profits based on ship date, there is a trend that caused a negative loss of furniture during January 2012. The data across the years showed that the sub-category, Tables, profitability decrease every year. Therefore, in the long run, the production for tables should decrease.
We will analyse Customer trends and their spending behaviours. Over the years, the highest spending category is Technology from customer in different years. With that, we should focus on selling other products in the same category as it would likely appeal to them as to increase sales. 2012 saw the lowest sales, mostly contributed by the loss in Q1 (as seen from the breakdown of category). Looking at the quarters of each year, there is a fixed trend of customers’ spending habit. Q1 sales will be low, and sales gradually increases towards Q4. Discounts follow this trend as well. We are therefore assuming here that cost prices have been decreased since profits increase this way as well.
Finally, we will be looking at the forecast of each sub-category, as well as the sales and how discounts affect the sales. The forecast would also project the segment of customer to focus on, hence helping the business focus and make better business decisions.
This would then help us better understand where to increase our investments in, therefore increasing overall profits.

## Introduction 
Given the dataset from 2011 Q1 to 2015 Q1, we will be looking into the key insights which would help the management make better decisions on where to invest their money in.

### Figure 1. Map of Countries in Clusters, sorted by Profits and Sales

This is an overall view of countries that are clustered by profit and sales. There are 3 clusters: high, medium and low. Each cluster will compromise of countries whose sales and profits are close to each other. The high cluster has an average profit of 286,397 while the low cluster has an average profit of 2,635 which shows huge disparity.  As seen on figure 1, it Is largely compromised by ‘Low’ clusters.  
In the following figures, clusters will be used to highlight the proportion of countries.
